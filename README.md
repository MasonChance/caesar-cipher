# Intro to Cryptography:

using the principles of the caesar cypher, write 3 functions:
- Encrypt: takes a string and a key, and returns a scrambled string where the alpha chars are shifted by the key
- Decrypt: takes the scrambled string and the key and returns the original string. 
- crack: takes an encrypted string and using nkltlib returns a dectypted string so long as the percent match is above 80 percent.
